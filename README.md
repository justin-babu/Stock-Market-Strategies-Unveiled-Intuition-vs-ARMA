# Stock-Market-Strategies-Unveiled-Intuition-vs-ARMA
## Aim:
Evaluate the effectiveness of a basic intuition-based trading strategy against an ARMA model in the stock market.
Assess the performance of the strategies for TATA MOTORS and RELIANCE stocks.
## Approach:
Implemented a basic trading strategy: Buy if the stock increases for 'b' consecutive days and sell if it decreases for 's' consecutive days.
Utilized an ARMA model for stock price predictions and compared its performance with the basic trading strategy.
## Results:
Backtesting revealed that the ARMA model consistently outperformed the intuition-based trading strategy in terms of returns.
Statistical metrics and visualizations demonstrated the superiority of data-driven approaches, emphasizing the limitations of intuition in stock market decision-making.
